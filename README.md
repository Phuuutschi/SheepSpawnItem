# SheepSpawnItem

Simple mod adding only one item wich spawns a sheep on rightclick.

Some files are named badly due to it being my first mod and the choices i made when creating th project :)

Therefore pretend that: 
"Sheepspawneritem.java" is named "SheepspawneritemMod.java"
"Sheepspawner.java" is named "Sheepspawneritem.java" (i could just rename this because it's in a sub-directory but i wanted to avoid two "Sheepspawneritem.java" files)
